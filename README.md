# LeapMotion-Drawing
This app was created during winter break in 2015. I had recently purchased a LeapMotion hand tracking device, and wanted to see it's capabilities inside of Unity. This was the first app I created, using cylinders to draw when the hand was pinched. Color can be changed by angling the left palm upwards, and cliding the color scale to select a color.
